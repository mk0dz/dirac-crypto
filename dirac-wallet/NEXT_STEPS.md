# Dirac Quantum-Resistant Wallet: Next Steps

This document outlines the future development roadmap for the Dirac Quantum-Resistant Solana Wallet.

## Fixed Issues

### JSON Serialization Fixes

We successfully addressed the JSON serialization issues by implementing the following fixes:

1. **Improved Key Encoding in QuantumKeyring**
   - Enhanced the `_encode_key` method to properly handle bytes objects
   - Added a recursive `_make_json_serializable` helper method to convert nested structures
   - Implemented proper type checking for all potential data types

2. **Wallet Data Serialization**
   - Added a `_ensure_json_serializable` helper method to DiracWallet
   - Implemented thorough validation before attempting to save wallet data
   - Added better error messages with detailed debugging information

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added traceback printing to see the full error stack
   - Implemented detailed error checking to identify problematic fields
   - Added pre-save validation to catch serialization issues early

These changes ensure that binary data from quantum cryptographic operations is properly encoded as base64 strings before being serialized to JSON, fixing the "Object of type bytes is not JSON serializable" error.

### Solana Integration Improvements

2. **Transaction Handling**
   - ✅ Improved the transaction creation and signing process
   - ✅ Added better error handling for transaction operations
   - ✅ Updated the balance checking mechanism to gracefully handle errors

### User Experience Improvements

1. **CLI Wrapper**
   - ✅ Created a bash script for easier wallet interaction
   - ✅ Added color-coded output for better readability
   - ✅ Implemented proper error handling and user feedback

2. **Demo Script**
   - ✅ Created a guided demo of wallet features
   - ✅ Added step-by-step walkthrough for users

## Implementation Notes

### Transaction Signing Integration

To fully integrate our quantum signatures with Solana's transaction format:

```python
# Modified send_transaction method
def send_transaction(self, recipient, amount):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Create a Solana transaction
    transaction = Transaction()
    
    # Add transfer instruction
    transaction.add(
        transfer(
            TransferParams(
                from_pubkey=sender_pubkey,
                to_pubkey=recipient_pubkey,
                lamports=lamports
            )
        )
    )
    
    # Get recent blockhash
    blockhash = self.client.get_latest_blockhash().value.blockhash
    transaction.recent_blockhash = blockhash
    
    # Sign with quantum key
    quantum_signature = self.keyring.sign_transaction(bytes(transaction), self.private_key)
    
    # Create Solana-compatible signature
    solana_signature = base64.b64encode(quantum_signature[:64]).decode('utf-8')
    
    # Add signature to transaction
    transaction.signatures.append(solana_signature)
    
    # Send transaction
    response = self.client.send_raw_transaction(transaction.serialize())
    
    return response.value
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Side-Channel Attacks**
   - Review all cryptographic operations for timing attacks
   - Implement constant-time operations where possible
   - Add memory clearing after sensitive operations

2. **Key Management**
   - Add secure key storage with encryption
   - Implement key rotation policies
   - Add emergency recovery features

3. **Quantum Threats**
   - Regularly update algorithms as quantum research progresses
   - Implement hybrid classical/quantum schemes during transition
   - Monitor quantum computing advancements closely
