## Running the Wallet

```bash
# Create a new wallet
./dirac-wallet.sh create my_wallet --sig sphincs --hash dirac_improved

# List all wallets
./dirac-wallet.sh list

# Check wallet balance
./dirac-wallet.sh balance my_wallet

# Send SOL (testnet)
./dirac-wallet.sh send my_wallet RECIPIENT_ADDRESS 0.01

# Run the guided demo
./demo.sh
```

## Next Steps
